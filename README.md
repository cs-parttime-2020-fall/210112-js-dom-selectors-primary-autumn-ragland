You will need bootstrap to complete this assignment. You can grab the CDN from [here](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/getting-started/introduction/#css) and access the component documentation [here](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/components/card/).

Requirements
1. Chose a background color for your page and pull all content away from the window similarly to the wireframes.
1. Display the assignment title as a centered heading at the top of the page.
1. Display a card with a heading and a description of what your site does.
1. Display another card with a heading that will display user items as list items using the [list group card](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/components/card/#list-groups). 
1. When the page loads the user should be prompted to add items to an array until five items have been entered or you enter "q".
1. Once the user is no longer being prompted display each item entered in the second card. If the user didn't enter any items display the message "The user did not enter any items".
